          <p>
            My name is Hanna, and I am an enthusiastic Junior Web Developer currently based 
            in London. I have a background in hospitality, an industry that has taught me a lot about 
            customer service and the importance of communication. After graduating from Makers Academy, an intensive 16 week coding bootcamp, 
            a while back, I have recently rediscoverd my passion for coding!
          </p>

            In my spare time, I enjoy playing the piano and video games, swimming, and cooking, to name 
            but a few. But most of all, I enjoy reading Fantasy and snuggling with my two cats, Luni 
            and Marley.
